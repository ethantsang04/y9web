<h2>Changes To My Design</h2>
<p>As a result of time constraints, code that was too difficult, new thoughts and ideas, my code has gone through a number of changes. Originally, I wanted my design to have a language setting at tht top, where the use could switch between languages. However, once I started writing the code, I realized that it would be too difficult and time consuming to do this. Another thing that I changed was the title. I wanted to use a white background, however thought it looked better with an image as a backgoround.Also, in my old plan, I wanted to have 1-2 different graphs. However, bar graphs or pie charts proved a little too difficult for me, so I just used the map. Furthermore, I decided to make my website a scroller rather than just a stationary page. I thought having everything spread out on one page was less of an eyesore for the user. Something very disappointing that happened to me was that parts of my map were missing when I uploaded the .json data. Mainly, I changed my code because the code was too difficult to program and help was unavailable to me or I thought changing the code ina specific way would actually improve the website.</p>
