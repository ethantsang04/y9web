<p>Some of the essential elements that are required for a good website are ergonomic factors such as easy navigation, easy access to help, and user-friendly interfaces. When creating the solution to my problem, a couple of criterion must be set, and achieved in order to have the most success possible. All the criteria set should be based off the top priority of making the website ergonomic. First of all, in order to achieve easy navigation through the website, I would like to implement a navigation bar that can easily take you to different pages from anywhere on the website. The navigation bar should remain at the top or right of the screen at all times no matter where the user is on the website. Second, I would like to be able to help the user whenever they are in a difficult situation by creating easy access to help. A help or FAQ button should be available to the user at all times in the navigation bar. This way, whenever the user doesnâ€™t know what to do, the help button will always be available to them. Finally, touching on user-friendly interfaces requires a mix of both aesthetics and a technical aspect. What separates a good looking website and a bad one is mainly organization. Thus, I want to have my site as clean and as organized as possible. In order for the user to understand the information I am providing them with, a chart can be provided to show them a percentage of people who have access to sanitation. In addition, users will be able to easily find a country they want to learn about through a dropdown box with a list of all countries or can just simply search for the country with an autofill.
<br>
Success Criteria:
<br>
<li>Must have navigation bar at top/side of screen at all times no matter where user is on page.
<br>
<li>Must have help/FAQ button at all times.
<br>
<li>Must have interactive charts and maps that can be clicked and information will be displayed.
<br>
<li>Must include dropdown box with countries and search bar for countries.
<br>
<li>Data must be presented in a neat and organized manner and divided into subsections.
<br>
<li>Target audience must be identified. Target audience is students who
<br>
<li>Must be able to use .JSON data and convert it into more appealing graphical data.
