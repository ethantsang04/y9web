<center><h1> Inquiry and Analysis - Basic Sanitation Services </h1></center>

<hr>

<center><h2>Explanation & Justification</h2></center>

<p>In more modern times, sanitation has become vital in our society. It is a necessity to be safe from diseases and prevent the transmission of diseases. As people become more aware of the importance of sanitation, naturally, the attempt to share this information becomes more frequent. Websites such as the World Health Organization (WHO) use charts and tabular data to display information about topics such as sanitation. However, these tables are very basic, displaying only a mere skeleton of data. Furthermore, they are not at all aesthetically pleasing to the eye, thus people tend to lose interest very quickly. Nowadays, people are drawn to more modern websites that use ergonomic websites that are user-friendly, simple and aesthetically appealing. Therefore, in order to share this vital information, one must transform the boring tabular data found on the WHO website and transform it into a website that can display data in a ergoomic fashion. So, it is thusly justified to develop a website using HTML that looks good, and shows sufficient data using graphs and charts rather than tabular data that can entice users to continue to read about this topic and become more aware of it, which in turn, will overall benefit those in need of basic sanitation services.</p>

<center><h2>Primary Research / Skills</h2></center>

<p>In order to achieve this type of website, a couple of basic skills are required. Basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript should all be used to create the best possible website to display this data. In order to create the "bare bones" of the website, HTML must be used to develop well-written and descriptive paragraphs the convey the data in an interesting way. However, sentences can not run on for too long, otherwise I might lose the interest of the user. This is the most important aspect of the website. In addition, CSS should be used to make the website look aesthetically pleasing. CSS is usually yu rfirst impression of a website. If it looks professional, people tend to stay and explore the page a little longer. On top of that, JavaScript must be utilised to add interactive functions. For this project, HTML and CSS are probably the more important languages when creating a solution to this problem. These are the languages that are essential to displaying data graphically. In addition, they compliment each other very well. CSS can be used to insert graphs, charts, etc, and HTML can inout raw data into these graphs and charts. Using CSS to create ways to display data graphically is another skill set that I will need to achieve in order to complete this project, along with some simple HTML to create the best website possible.</p>

<center><h2>Research Plan</h2></center>

<p>
	1. Research how to convert .json data into graphical data using HTML.
	<br>
	2. Research how to create graphs using HTML and CSS.
	<br>
	3. Research how to create easy navigation and dropdowns to look for different countries.
	<br>
	4. Learn to make side/top tabs to navigate though different parts of the website.
	<br>
	5. Add search bar and keybinds such as enter or delete to make things easier.

<center><h2>Inspiration Range of Existing Products</h2></center>

<h3>1. <a href="http://population.io/">Population.io</a></h3>
<br>
<p>Population.io is a fantastic website that uses CSS and JavaScript beautifully to create a very professional looking website with multiple decorations and canvas animations.</p>
<br>
<h3>2. <a href="http://www.aegea.com.br/en/2013/01/what-is-basic-sanitation/">What is Basic Sanitation?</a></h3>
<br>
<p>Another website that looks great. It has a very simple look to it, which makes it more appealing to the eye.</p>
<br>
<h3>3. <a href="https://www.futureagenda.org/insight/basic-sanitation">Basic Sanitation</a></h3>
<br>
<p>This website uses a search bar and menu bar at the bottom to be more easy to navigate. This is something I would like to implement into my webpage. It is also very aesthetically pleasing.</p>

<center><h2>Design Brief</h2></center>

<p>
	1. Will have search bar that allows the user to easily find the country they are trying to get information on.
	<br>
	2. Will have high resolution images and HTML canvas animations.
	<br>
	3. Will have data shown graphically (ie. pie charts, bar graphs, line graphs)
	<br>
	4. Will have a FAQ button for users that may be confused or have a question in mind.
	<br>
	5. Will have internal links to WHO website and others if user has any further interests.
